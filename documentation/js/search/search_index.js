you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.\n\nBefore submitting a bug, make sure it is reproduced on the latest version of the project.\n\n\nHow do I submit a good bug report?\nBugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:\n\nUse a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.\nDescribe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.\nProvide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.\nDescribe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.\nExplain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.\nInclude screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool on Linux.\nIf the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.\n\nTesting\nWe have most part of our code in Python. Hence, whenever changes are added to the repo, it is highly advised to add unit tests for that. It helps track bugs and maintain the highest level of test coverage for the project.\nSubmitting changes\nPlease send a GitHub Pull Request to arnab-95/se-group38-hw with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests). We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).\nAlways write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:\n$ git commit -m \"A brief summary of the commit\n> \n> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact.\"Coding conventions\nStart reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability. We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)\nCode of Conduct\nThis project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Project Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the repo owner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results
