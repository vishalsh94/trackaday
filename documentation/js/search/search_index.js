you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.\n\nBefore submitting a bug, make sure it is reproduced on the latest version of the project.\n\n\nHow do I submit a good bug report?\nBugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:\n\nUse a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.\nDescribe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.\nProvide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use Markdown code blocks.\nDescribe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.\nExplain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.\nInclude screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool on Linux.\nIf the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened and share more information using the guidelines below.\n\nTesting\nWe have most part of our code in Python. Hence, whenever changes are added to the repo, it is highly advised to add unit tests for that. It helps track bugs and maintain the highest level of test coverage for the project.\nSubmitting changes\nPlease send a GitHub Pull Request to arnab-95/se-group38-hw with a clear list of what you've done (read more about pull requests). We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).\nAlways write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:\n$ git commit -m \"A brief summary of the commit\n> \n> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact.\"Coding conventions\nStart reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability. We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)\nCode of Conduct\nThis project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Project Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the repo owner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results

desktop programme helps you monitor and enhance your productivity.\nA desktop programme called Track-a-Day can be utilized to keep track of daily tasks. The tasks that users wish to finish are added.\nThe user then adjusts the timer to retain track of their progress. Every hour, a pop-up encourages the user with an encouraging phrase. After the timer has begun, a pause and stop button is presented. The timer can be halted by users for breaks. Users can suspend the timer at the end of the day to get an overview of the current session.\nUser can access a report on their session evaluation. Users receive up to 30 sessions to assess.\nDemo Video\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1YQajSqeIZ3xLBDmzofZ_2pLaI2lc6nsD/view \nInstallation and Usage\nYou must have npm installed on your system. \nRun the following commands to install Angular and Electron.js- \nnpm install -g @angular/clinpm install --save-dev electron@latestClone the repository and cd into the root directory. Then run the following commands - \nnpm installnpm startThe desktop application should open in a new window.\nThe home page has a timer and a ToDo List. You can add your items in the ToDo list and press START to begin tracking your progress. \nClick PAUSE if you want to take a break and STOP if you want to close out the work session. \nWhile the timer is RUNNING or is PAUSED (not STOPPED) you will receive a desktop notification (works on both Windows and Mac) every hour to make sure you are engaged and not distracted during your session. (This will run at the beginning of every hour e.g. at 1PM, 2PM, 3PM etc according to the local clock of your computer) \n\nWhen you click STOP and close out the session, the amount of time you worked, took a break and the number of activities you completed will be logged in the database. \nWhen you click on the Analytics tab, you can see information about your weekly performance. \n\nIt shows you the number of hours worked per day as well as when you usually work during the day. \nDocumentation\nhttps://arnab-95.github.io/ \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2022 arnab-95\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
